# CS3004 Network Computing Coursework

Developed in Java with the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

## Requirments

> You are required to design and implement an application that takes data from a user that is the reading from their medical device on one console, formats it for transmission, and displays on a second console. The second console must send an acknowledgement of successful receipt of data to the first console before further data can be sent.

> The application will support data from at least a weighing scale (in lb or kg) and from a blood pressure meter that gives systolic and diastolic pressure (mmHg) and pulse rate (beats per minute â€“ bpm). Each reading shall be given a timestamp of the time that it is entered on the console and reading, units and timestamp are to be placed in the message that is sent.

> You are required to describe the design of the user interface and how you then create a message from the user input (sending the text entered by the user is not a solution).
